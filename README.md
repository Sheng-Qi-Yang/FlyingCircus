# Bootcamp

Authors:  Chris Burns and Shannon Patel (Carnegie Observatories)

Just a safe place to put our ipython notebook tutorials for the summer bootcamp held
at the Carnegie Observatories.

The notebooks make reference to the data files that are also located in this repository.
There are also some sample scripts that can be useful seeing how to do some of the
exercises.

To download this repository to your computer, run:

```   git clone https://github.com/obscode/bootcamp.git```
   
This will create a folder (`bootcamp`). Change to this folder and run the `jupyter` notebook viewer:

```   jupyter-notebook```
   
You should now get a browser from which you can select and launch the various `ipython` notebook files (`*.ipynb`).
