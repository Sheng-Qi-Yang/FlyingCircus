    "Bayesian statistics is based on  Bayes' theorem (for an excellent intro, see [3blue1brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM)). It's actually a very simple idea and an equally simple equation. It's *dealing* with the equation that gets complicated. Let's say we have some data $\\vec{D}$. In the case of our emission line, the data is the number of counts in each wavelength bin. We have a model with some number of parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$. Bayes' theorem simply states:\n",
    "$$P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\left|\\vec{D}\\right.\\right) = \\frac{P\\left(\\vec{D}\\left|\\vec{\\theta}\\right.\\right)P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\right)}{P\\left(\\vec{D}\\right)}$$\n",
    "What this says is that the probability that we get a particular set of parameters given a fixed set of data (which is what we want) is proportional to the probability that we get the data given a fixed set of parameters (which we can calculate) times the probability of the parameters (the priors). The denominator is the probability that we got the data we did, which requires integrating over all possible parameters:\n",
    "$$P\\left(\\vec{D}\\right) = \\int P\\left(\\vec{D}\\left|\\vec{\\theta}\\right.\\right)P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\right)\\ d\\vec{\\theta}$$\n",
    "and really just ensures that the probability is normalized to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder what the difference between the priors $P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\right)$ and $P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\left|\\vec{D}\\right.\\right)$ (called the likelihood) is. The likelihood is what your data tells you about the parameters. The priors are constraints that are external to the data. It could be a previous experiment's result that you are incorporating into your own. It could be a purely logical constraint (e.g., the age of the universe must be greater than 0), it could even be a *gut feeling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with the above equation isn't too bad if the number of parameters is small and the priors and likelihoods are all simple. In fact, if you use uniform priors and normally-distributed errors, you get the good-old least-squares formalism. But pretty quickly you can get in a situation where the equation (and integrals of the equation) are not possible to evaluate analytically. This is where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is useful."

    "Now that we have the probability all figured out, we could in principle figure out where it is maximal and compute the 1-2-3-sigma intervals. This may or may not be possible in \"closed form\". The more parameters, priors and complicated the model gets, the less likely you'll be able to compute the derivatives (for optimization) and integrals (for expectation values and confidence intervals). But we can always compute these numerically and that's what MCMC is all about. With the ``emcee`` module, we do this by creating a bunch of \"walkers\" that wander around parameter space, always seeking higher probability regions, but also randomly sampling the space. After a certain amount of time, they wander around randomly enough that they lose track of where they started. When this happens, the steps the walkers take is a reflection of $P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\left|\\vec{D}\\right.\\right)$. So inferences about the moments of $P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\left|\\vec{D}\\right.\\right)$ can be determined by doing statistics on the walkers' steps. For example, the expectation (mean value) of the amplitude is:\n",
    "$$\\left<A\\right> \\equiv \\int P\\left(\\vec{\\theta}\\left|\\vec{D}\\right.\\right)A d\\vec{\\theta} \\simeq mean(A_i)$$\n",
    "where A_i are the values of ``amp`` at each step $i$. The more steps you take, the more accurate the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we create a number of walkers and start them off in random locations around parameter space. In this example, we know the true values so we just perturb around that. When you don't know the true values, you could start in completely random locations or use other tools (like ``curve_fit``) to find an initial starting point."
