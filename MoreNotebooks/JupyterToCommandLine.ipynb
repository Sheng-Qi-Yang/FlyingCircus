    "Jupyter notebooks are great as a learning environment and even as a development environment *if it works for you*. But it has a number of disadvantages which were probably covered already, but here are a few:\n",
    " - The state is not well-defined:  you can execute cells multiple times or out of order and that can lead to strange bugs;\n",
    " - It's generally more difficult to setup a jupyter notebook on a remote host;\n",
    " - The editing environment is rather primitive compared to other editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environment);\n",
    " - Interactive plots can be difficult/unstable (though this will likely improve with time)\n",
    " - It's *very* difficult (maybe impossible) to submit a jupyter notebook to an HPC cluster or cloud computing service (though check out the [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)).\n",
    " \n",
    "There are several alternative ways to run your python code. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Executing from the command-line\n",

    "## The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen in the Unix tutorial how to run commands from the terminal. Most of these commands are written in C/C++. There are likely some written in a scripting language called `perl` and in Linux operating systems, some are even written in `python`. But you'd never know it, as they all behave just like regular Unix commands. So let's see how we'd take a jupyter notebook and make it into a command-line program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting a Notebook to python script\n",
    "\n",
    "A python script is just a plain ASCII file with python statements in it. You could copy-paste a jupyter notebook's execution cells and paste them into a file and that would give you a python script. Or, let jupyter do it for you:  select `File -> Download as -> Python (.py)` from the menu above and jupyter will not only export the execution cells, it will include all the Markdown cells as comments. That gets you 99% of the way there! Try it now with this notebook and it will download a file named `JupyterToCommandLine.py` (probably in your `Downloads` folder). Open `JupyterToCommandLine.py` with a text editor (e.g., `TextEdit.app` on a Mac, or `Notebook` on Windows) and have a look. You can now run this from the command line by typing this in a terminal (except for the `$` which signifies the command prompt):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python ~/Downloads/JupyterToCommandLine.py\n",
    "\n",
    "It will certainly do *something*, maybe even everything your original notebook did, but likely you'll need to do some cleanup work. The rest of this notebook covers this cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shebang!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed these odd lines at the top of the script that was created:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "    # coding: utf-8\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is called a *shebang* and starts with `#!`. That signals to the operating system that this script should be run with `python`. If you make your script executable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod +x ~/Downloads/JupyterToCommandLine.py \n",
    "    \n",
    "Then you can execute the script without having to call the `python` executable explicitly, thanks to the shebang:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ~/Downloads/JupyterToCommandLine.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "Better yet, if you move the script to a folder in your `$PATH`, you can just run the command all by itself:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Command-line arguments\n",

With only a few, it's not too bad; you just have to remember how many and which one is first, second, etc. But as you write more complicated scripts, programs, or even applications, it can get complicated. Luckily, there's a built-in module specifically for dealing with *parsing* command-line arguments. \n",

Here, after you've setup your graph the way to you want to present it, you then run `plt.show()`. This will launch a pop-pup window with your graph. It will also have buttons that allow the user to pan/zoom, modify the margins, and save the plot to a file. Try changing the `plt.savefig()` command to a `plt.show()` instead and-rerun the script from the command-line. Now you can zoom in on the left-hand part of the plot.\n",

See the [interactive plotting](./plotting_interactive.ipynb) notebook for examples of this.\n"
