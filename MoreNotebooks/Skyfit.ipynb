    "This notebook is a case study in working with python and several modules. It's a real problem I had to solve with real data. There are *many* ways to attack a problem such as this; this is simply one way. The point is to illustrate how you can get existing modules to do the heavy-lifting for you and that visualization is a powerful diagnostic tool. Try not to get caught up in the details of the model; it's quite complex and the point is not to understand all the equations, but the *procedure* of exploring data and fitting it to a model (read the citation if you're really interested all the gory details).\n",

Suffice it to say for the moment that this is an approximation very close to the \"infinite slab\" model of the atmosphere.

    "You will see that there are some patterns that are correctly predicted, but others that are not. In particular, there's a whole cloud of points with $\\alpha < 0.8$ and sky brightness > 22 that are observed but *not* predicted. In other words, we observed some objects where the moon was relatively bright, yet the sky was relatively dark.\n",

    "This is where I hit a bit of a wall in my investigation. It was not at all obvious where these points were coming from because the data set was so large and we have so many variables at work. However, by luck this ended up being around the time that Shannon was playing around with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) and it turned out to be exactly what I needed to explore where things were not working correctly. Let's do that now.\n",

    "### 5) Plotting Residuals\n",
    "A good way to see where a model is failing is to plot the residuals (observed - model). Where the residuals are close to zero, the model is doing a good job, but where the residuals are large (positive or nagative), the model is failing to capture something. A good diagnostic is to plot these residuals versus each of your variables and see where things go wrong. The great thing about Bokeh is it gives a very powerful way to do this:  linking graphs so that selecting points in one graph will select the corresponding points in all other graphs that share the same dataset. This is why we've been adding our variables to the pandas `dataFrame`, `data`:  that's what Bokeh uses for plotting. In this code block we setup a Bokeh graph and plot 6 different \"slices\" through our multi-dimenisonal data. In the resulting plots, try selecting different regions of the upper-left panel (the residuals) to see if they correspond to interesting sets of parameters in the other panels."

Just [go back](#airmass) to the cell above where `X(Z)` is defined and change it. Then select `Cell -> Run All Below` from the menu so see how the results change.

The answer:  Google, ADS, and 20+ years (eek!) of experience coding in Python. I also neglected to show all the dead-ends and mistakes I made on the way to getting the final solution, all the emails I sent to Kevin asking about the details of his paper, and trips to Shannon's office to get help with using Bokeh.\n",

It has never been so easy to do this, thanks to search engines ([Google](https://www.google.com), et al.), data/software catalogs ([PyPI](https://pypi.org), et al.), discussion groups ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), et al.) and even social media ([python users in astronomy facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/astropython/), etc).
