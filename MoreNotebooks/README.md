# Extra Notebooks

In this folder you'll find more example notebooks that we've put together.
Here is a brief synopsis of each:

* BuggyPrograms.ipynb:  A good deal of time is spent debugging. Here's some
  code that has common mistakes. Try to find them all!

* AstropySmorgasbord.ipynb: A notebook that shows all kinds of useful
  astro-related tasks using the astropy package.

* ModelFitting:  A filder with 3 notebooks on fitting models in various
  ways.

* Skyfit.ipynb: fit real data of sky background levels and try to model the 
  contribution from the moon. Uses scipy to fit the model and bokeh to
  visualize the multi-dimensional data set.
