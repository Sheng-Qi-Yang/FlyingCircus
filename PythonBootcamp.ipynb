    "There are many environments in which one can run Python code:\n",
    "- iPython notebooks like this one are good for running quick snippets of code.\n",
    "- Spyder (provided with Anaconda) provides a space for writing scripts, executing them, and also for easily looking up definitions of different functions. Very similar to the IDL graphical IDE.\n",
    "- One can also write code in a plain text editor, like Emacs/Aquamacs.  Then execute the code in a terminal running Python or iPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running code from the command-line\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common and *agnostic* way to run your code. If you send your code to someone else, assume they will run it from the command line. If you are running your code on an HPC cluster, it needs to be run from the command-line. Lastly, writing code that runs with minimal user-interaction makes it more repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two aspects of writing command-line code that you should be familiar with: 1) getting arguments from the command line; and 2) working with files. The first is done through the `sys.argv` variable, the second is done with `os.path` package. Here we look at each briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `sys.argv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite simply, this is a list of the command-line arguments. You've seen several unix commands. Suppose we wanted to write the equivalent of the `cp` command, but using a python script. Usually, you run the command like this from the command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cp file1 file2\n",
    "\n",
    "That would copy file1 to file2. So our python script will need to get both the source and destination file name. Here is how I would write a simple script to do the same thing as `cp`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    f1 = sys.argv[1]\n",
    "    f2 = sys.argv[2]\n",

    "    # Here would be the code to actually copy one file to the other\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: you can try to print out sys.argv on the next command-block. It will show you how this ipython notebook was actually run. But it is not very useful for doing anything practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more complicated code, your command-line arguments may also get rather complicated (you may have optional arguments, switches, etc). There is a really good module in `python` for dealing with such complicated arguments so that your script isn't filled with code just to deal with parsing `sys.argv`. Have a look at the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html) module when you get to the point where you need to deal with complicated command-lines arguments."
