# Various Scripts

This folder has some scripts that don't quite fit into the jupyter notebook
framework, but still show some useful stuff.

 * multiprocessing_simple.py:  How you can do parallel processing using 
   python's `multitasking` module.
 * visualize_cosmo.py:  interactive matplotlib script that shows how type Ia
   supernova data constrains cosmology (Omega_m and Omega_l). Click and drag
   in the Omega-matter/Omega-Lambda plot and see how the fit changes in the
   Hubble diagram.
